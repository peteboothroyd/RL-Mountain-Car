#  Overview
A simple exercise in RL to control an underactuated car up a hill, based on the classic Mountain Car problem. This builds on the paper by Carl Rasmussen and Malte Kuss [here](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2420-gaussian-processes-in-reinforcement-learning.pdf).

To run:

``` bash
python3 gaussian_car_on_the_hill.py
```

Add the `--visualise=True` flag to save out visualisations of the value function and actions through the learning process.
